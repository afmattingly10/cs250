In order to interpret user needs into a program you can create user stories which are detailed responses of what the client wants and how it should work. The developer can use this as a guide to create and the tester can use it to make sure evrything is right. When developing programs it is important to lay out everything that needs to be done, have good communication, break up the work, and test everything often. In order to incoperoate the agile process into my future development work I would need to create a schedule, break up the work, have daily meetings to ensure communcation, update the team with problems, ask questions when needed, and have sprints to check the work. A good team member makes sure everything is getting done, they communicate and check up with the team, and they leave comments about there work so others can see it later and understand the thought process.
